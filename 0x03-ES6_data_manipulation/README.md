## Project Structure

The project is organized into several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of ES6 data manipulation. Here are the tasks included in this project:

1. Basic list of objects
2. More mapping
3. Filter
4. Reduce
5. Typed Arrays
6. Set data structure
7. More set data structure
8. Clean set
9. Map data structure
10. More map data structure

## Installation and Setup

1. Install NodeJS 12.11.x:
   ```bash
   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
   sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
   sudo apt install nodejs -y
   ```

2. Check NodeJS and npm versions:
   ```bash
   nodejs -v
   npm -v
   ```

3. Install Jest, Babel, and ESLint:
   Navigate to your project directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run tests:
   - For linting: `npm run lint`
   - For Jest tests: `npm run test`
   - For full test suite: `npm run full-test`

## Usage

Each task has its own JavaScript file in the project directory. You can run individual tasks using the provided `npm run dev` command followed by the task file.

Example:
```bash
npm run dev 0-main.js
npm run dev 1-main.js
# and so on for other tasks
